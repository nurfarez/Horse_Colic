## Summary and Motivation

The purpose of this project is to predict the survival of horse based on given medical conditions either lived,died or was euthanized. The project was classified under
classification problem and been solved by the deep learning approach.

- Research Questions
1. What are the model accuracy that correctly predicts the horse's survival accordingly
2. What are the best features used for the classification model

## Libraries that been used

- matplotlib.pyplot 
- numpy
- pandas
- os
- sklearn
- datetime
- tensorflow

The results of this analysis: The accuracy obtained for this classification model is around 0.71 where about 54 horses is correctly predicted to be lived with the medical conditions lying. 
and the best features used for this model are cell_volume(packed cell volume) and type of lesion 1(lesion 25)
